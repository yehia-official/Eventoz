# 📅 Eventoz

Just launched my **event planning project** — *Eventoz*, a smooth and minimal event organizer interface! 🎊

## 📌 About the Project

The idea came from needing a simple way to manage and view events in a clean layout.  
**Eventoz** helps you plan, view, and manage events with a beautiful responsive UI — perfect for learning structure, layout, and interaction basics.

## 🔧 What I Used

- ✅ **HTML5** — for structure  
- ✅ **CSS3 / Flexbox / Grid** — for styling and layout  
- ✅ **Responsive Design** — for all screen sizes  
- ✅ *(Add JavaScript / Bootstrap / Frameworks if used)*

> 🚀 *This is just the beginning — more features and improvements coming soon!*
